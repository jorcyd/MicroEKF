# MicroEKF
A direct fork/derivation from simondlevy's original TinyEKF(https://github.com/simondlevy/TinyEKF) project. This branch is intended towards making the C/C++ more parametric/plataform-agnostic and highly-performant as possible towards embedded systems. Is also under test on "exotic" plataforms such as WebAssembly. This code is still highly experimental and comes with no warranties whatsover, use it at your own risk.
