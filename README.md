# MicroEKF: High-Performance Embedded C/C++ Extended Kalman Filter
A direct fork/derivation from simondlevy's original TinyEKF (https://github.com/simondlevy/TinyEKF) project.<br>
This branch is intended towards making the C/C++ more parametric, plataform-agnostic and highly-performant as possible on embedded systems and low-to-middle-end devices. Is also under test on atypical plataforms such as WebAssembly.<br>
<br>
The code is still highly experimental and comes with absolutely no warranties.<br>
The author exempts itself from any form of misusage or potential virtual/physical harm it may cause.<br>
Use it at your own risk.<br>
